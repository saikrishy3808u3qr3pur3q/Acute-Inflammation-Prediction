# Acute-Inflammation-Prediction

## Federated Learning for Acute Inflammation Prediction
- This project demonstrates federated learning for predicting acute inflammation using a neural network model. The dataset used for training and testing contains information about patients' symptoms and diagnoses. The goal is to predict two diseases: inflammation of the urinary bladder and nephritis of renal pelvis origin. </br>

## Requirements
- Python 3.x </br>
- PyTorch </br>
- pandas </br>
- scikit-learn </br>
- ipywidgets </br>
## Installation
- Clone the repository: </br>

- git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git </br>
- cd your_repository </br>
- Install the required packages: </br>

- pip install -r requirements.txt </br>

## Usage
- Prepare the dataset: Download the dataset from here and place it in the project directory. </br>

- Run the Jupyter notebook federated_learning_acute_inflammation.ipynb to train the model using federated learning and evaluate its performance. </br>

- Follow the instructions in the notebook to interact with the UI for making predictions on new data. </br>

## Files
- federated_learning_acute_inflammation.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for federated learning. </br>
- diagnosis_1.csv: Dataset containing patient information. </br>
